                <h2>Media Queries</h2>
                <p>With media queries we can ask for certain types of output and additional features.
                    Depending on those we can change styles for these features.<br>
                    Media Queries are stylesheets within stylesheets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the rules within the media query are changing. 
                    Everything else stays the same.

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>Look at the stylesheet for this document.
                    Use the develper tools to inspect what's happening.
                </p>
                <p>You can test lots of things with attributes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>width</code><br>
                    the viewport width</li>
                    <li><code>height</code><br>
                    the viewport height</li>
                    <!-- the following will be deprecated in Media Queries Level 4: 
                    <li><code>device-width</code><br>
                    the viewport width of the specific device</li>
                    <li><code>device-height</code><br>
                    the viewport height of the specific device</li> -->
                    <li><code>orientation</code><br>
                    landscape or portrait orientation of the device</li>
                    <li><code>aspect-ratio</code><br>
                    the ration of width to height</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The are many more conditions to test.

                <h2>Using device pixels</h2>
                <p>Pixels are relative! Compare the resolution of your desktop and your phone.
                    CSS-pixels are rendered on your device. If you develop on your desktop and make your viewport smaller or larger,
                    it's still on your desktop! It won't work on a handheld device.
                </p>
                <p>Use your meta-tag to set the CSS-width equal to the device-width.</p>

                <h2>Syntax</h2>
                <p>
<pre>
<code>@media type (features){
    /*rules for thes features*/
}
</code>
</pre>          If you don't include a type it will target to all types (screen, print, ...)<br>
                For the features, mostly you will ref a certain width.<br>
                <code>min-width</code> mean from this width and larger, 
                so it's for a larg(er) screen. <code>max-width</code> works the other way around.
                You can also work within a range between min-width and max-width.
                </p>
                <p>
                Working with <code>min-width</code> means you are working desktop-first.
                The order of media queries is important! If you work with <code>min-width</code>,
                you work from the smallest to the biggest.
                </p>
                <p><em>Try the whole stylesheet mobile-first!</em></p>

                <h2>Organizing media queries within a stylesheet</h2>
                <p>There is no right or wrong way to organize media queries.
                    Be consistent! You can write all rules within one media query or you can write a media query just after each separate rule that needs one.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>use up your space</li>
                    <li>use one column</li>
                    <li>make forms usable</li>

                <h2>Breakpoints</h2>
                <p>
                    Breakpoints are the width at which we want to change the design.<br>
                    Don't use standard breakpoints. 
                    Better, look at the screen and decide at what point does the layout look wrong.
                    It depends on your design. Try different breakpoints.
                    Don't target specific devices, because there are just too many.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For maintainability keep the breakpoints to a minimum.
                    The more breakpoints you have, the more adjustments you have to make, 
                    if you are making changes to on breakpoint.
